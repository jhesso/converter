todo:

- add speed conversion (mph/kmh etc.)
	- mph and kmh done, add other units like m/s etc.
- extend length conversion to allow for converting from meters to millimeters and shit like that
- add support for area conversions (square meter to square foot etc.)
	- square meter and foot are done, add other units.
- add support for volume conversion (cubic meter to Gallons and shit like that)
	- needs support for more units than gallons and liters 
- extend weight conversion to allow for converting to more units, milligrams, grams etc.
- change the value and unit getting into its own function (check notes file)
	- kinda what i did with time.cpp in unitSelection() function
- finish writing the new values.cpp functions and fix selection.cpp (and other related files) to use the new system.
