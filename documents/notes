	just realized that the "main" for each conversion could be done in one fail. all the units and values could be asked in one function
	from which we then would proceed to the correct converting functions. 
	some pseudo code:
		void	values(string selectedTypeOfUnit)
			double	valueOriginal
			char	unitOriginal
			char	unitTarget
		
			std::cin >> unitOriginal
			std::cin >> unitTarget
			std::cin >> valueOriginal
			if selectedTypeOfUnit == speed
				speed(valueOriginal, unitOriginal, unitTarget);
			else if selectedTypeOfUnit == area
				area(valueOriginal, unitOriginal, unitTarget);
	
	could even handle error cases here.

	in time.cpp (and possibly on every conversion) could switch to using integers representing all available selections
	for example:
		int unitO;
		available units: 1 = minutes, 2 = seconds, 3 = hours, 4 = milliseconds, 5 = days etc...
	instead of using strings (in time conversion) or chars to select the unit. could make the user experiense easier
	and to better avoid user mistakes (typos etc.)

	in conversions when selecting types of units (target and original), could have a seperate function in which it is done
	this way theres no need to do so many if/while conditions, only one would be needed. also could start using cases instead of
	if conditions to make it more readable.

	there has to be a better way to do what timeconvertions.cpp does...
